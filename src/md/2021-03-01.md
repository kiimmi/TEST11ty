Anyway theres this old kid and he's a pacifist which is kinda lame but ok, he's a monk so makes sense ig. The firelords kinda commited genicide and are trying to achieve world domination but ok forgiveness ig. Zuko had a glow up and has a goth gf so he's the one that's rlly winning in the show. Aang got friendzoned a few times so maybe Katara was just like ooh the avatar or something. She's technically a good person just kinda annoying so I like Katara slander.
